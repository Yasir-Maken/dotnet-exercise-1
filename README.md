# My First .NET C# Project on Linux!

Hi there! This is a very simple project I created while learning how to set up a .NET development environment on my Ubuntu machine and use some basic Git commands.

## What I Did

Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished:

1.  **Installed .NET Runtime and SDK:** I successfully installed the necessary tools from Microsoft to build and run .NET applications. This included the core runtime environment and the Software Development Kit (SDK) which has compilers and other development tools.

2.  **Installed VS Code IDE:** I set up Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular and free code editor, on my system. This is where I wrote the C# code.

3.  **Installed C# Development Extension:** To get the best experience for writing C# in VS Code, I installed the official C# extension from Microsoft. This provides features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging support.

4.  **Wrote a Simple Program:** I created a basic C# program that does the following:
    * Asks you to enter your name in the console.
    * Reads the name you type.
    * Prints a greeting in the console that says "Hello, " followed by your name.

5.  **Practiced Basic Git Commands:** I also practiced using some fundamental Git commands to manage this project:
    * **`git init`**: This command initialized a new Git repository locally in my project folder, allowing me to start tracking changes.
    * **`git add .`**: This command added all the files in my project folder to the staging area, preparing them for a commit.
    * **`git commit -m "Initial commit: Setup and simple hello program"`**: This command saved the changes I staged with a descriptive message.
    * **`git push origin main`**: This command pushed my local commits to a remote repository on GitHub (I assume you have already created a repository on GitHub and set up the remote origin).

## How to Run the Program (if you want to try it!)

If you have .NET installed on your machine, you can run this simple program:

1.  **Clone this repository** to your local machine using `git clone (https://github.com/Yasir-Maken/dotnet-exercise-1.git).
2.  **Navigate** to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  **Run** the program using the command `dotnet run`.
4.  You'll be prompted to enter your name in the console. Type it and press Enter!

This was a great first step for me in learning .NET and getting familiar with Git. Thanks for checking it out!
